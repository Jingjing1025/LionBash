===== Overview =====

LionBash is an event-based web platform designed exclusively for Columbia students to view, join, and post events in various categories. This platform will enable both the university official organizations and the individual event organizers to attract more student participants through such information exposure. It also helps the event explorers to easily find their interested activities by gathering information about current and upcoming events happening within or outside of Columbia. LionBash welcomes all parties to explore what is going on in the Columbia community, and to join and post a wide range of events for themselves. 

The events are grouped by their categories, such as official events, created by Columbia faculty and staff, organization events, created by Columbia student organizations, and individual events, created by the students themselves. In the future, there will also be relevant tags for each event, such as department, career, or entertainment, to enhance the user browsing experience.
